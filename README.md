* Web scrap British Museum reviews from Tripadvisor
* Perform sentiment analysis
* Perform topic modelling to gain insights on visitor reviews

* **Word cloud representing the words used in positive reviews left by visitors:**

Positive reviews of the museum were mainly about 2 topics: its temporary exhibitions (one of which is the Troy exhibition) and its permanent exhibitions.

The collections displayed in the permanent collection, e.g. items in the Egyptian gallery and the Rosetta Stone were mentioned frequently in the positive reviews, as well as the fact that its entrance is free of charge.


* **Words used in negative reviews:**

Looking at the topic modelling results, it seems like the negative reviews revolved around only one topic. The negative reviews were mostly about the exhibitions and the crowds. The imperialist controversies around British Museum, primarily its acquisition of items of like the Elgin Marbles and the Rosetta Stone were not mentioned as frequently in the reviews.

To improve visitor experience, the museum can work on improving how the exhibitions are organised and crowd management.



## [Predicting Cancellation of Hotel Reservations](https://rpubs.com/jiajianwoo95/706496)
* Analysed guest visits at a city hotel and a resort
* Analysed reservation cancellation behaviour
* Built a model to predict whether guests would cancel their reservations

Significant proportion of guests cancelled their hotel reservations.

People from some countries are more likely to cancel their reservations compared to other countries.

The above graph compares the predictions made by the model on the number of cancellations every day with the actual number.
